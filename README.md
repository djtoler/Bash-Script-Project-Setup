# Bash-Script-Project-Setup
Set up project faster using scripts to download packages, directories and files


Made my first automation script to set up my projects faster.
This is version1. I will expand this to include more packages.
The idea im contemplating is scraping npm website for packages install commands and comparing them to a terminal useres input for automate package installation
